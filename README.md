# reformat-data-files
This is the second homework in CSC 215
This program is started using command line arguments. The first argument is the name of the input file and the second is the name of the output file. The basic task of this program is to transfer the data from one file to another making changes to the number of data values in the file if needed. The program will also add the min and max values to the file and format the output data values to have 5 per line and all real numbers will have 3 decimal digits of precision displayed.
